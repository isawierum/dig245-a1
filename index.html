<b> Hello from the other side </b>

  a.  Isabelle (Isa) Wierum
      Junior
      Bioinformatics

  b. Because it looked interesting!

  c. Some programming expierence from Davidson classes

  d. To learn something new

  e.
    i) Papa's Freezeria. http://www.flipline.com/games/papasfreezeria/. It's
      just an online game, but it just is simple and fun. I'd like to be able
      to learn how to make something similar someday.
    ii) Apple. https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/ Just the way they do this
      scrolling effect still kind of blows my mind a little bit.
    iii) Netflix party. https://www.netflixparty.com/ It's actually a chrome
      extension, but I really appreciate that it's there, especially since I
      would like to see something like this for other streaming services but
      haven't been able to find it. It lets me stay connected to other people
      Through watching movies together, which is something I really care about.
