        <li>Because it looked interesting!</li><br>

        <li>Some programming expierence from Davidson classes</li><br>

        <li>To learn something new</li><br>

        <li>Projects<br>

            <li>Papa's Freezeria. http://www.flipline.com/games/papasfreezeria/.
              It's just an online game, but it just is simple and fun. I'd like to
              be able to learn how to make something similar someday.</li><br>
            <li>Apple. https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/ Just the way they do this
              scrolling effect still kind of blows my mind a little bit.</li> <br>
            <li>Netflix party. https://www.netflixparty.com/ It's actually a
              chrome extension, but I really appreciate that it's there,
              especially since I would like to see something like this for other
              streaming services buthaven't been able to find it. It lets me stay
              connected to other people through watching movies together, which is
              something I really care about.</li>
